  LOG4J2 CONFIGURATION: The "Observability" Engine.

  THE WALMART HEADACHE I FIXED:
  - THE PROBLEM: We were running thousands of tests in the cloud, but when 
    something failed, I had to manually log into a Linux server just to find 
    the log file. It was taking way too long to find the root cause.
  - WHAT I DID: I configured this multi-appender system. It still logs to the 
    Console and a File, but I added a "Splunk HEC" (HTTP Event Collector). 
    Now, every log line is sent instantly to a Splunk Dashboard.
  - THE RESULT: I created a "Quality Dashboard" for the whole team. If a 
    service goes down, we see the red alerts in Splunk before the tests 
    even finish. It turned my logs into real-time monitoring.
